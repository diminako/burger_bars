# Retro Backlog  
![badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Nintendo&message=SNES&color=red)  
## Description  
This is a Full-Stack Application utilizing HTML/CSS JavaScript, node.js, express, handlebars,  
and mySQL.  This database is hosted on Heroku.  I used Bootstrap and a nes.css framework for  
the design.  This application allows you to create new items to add to your backlog of games  
that you still need to beat, read from the database to determine whether or not the item in the  
database has already been completed or not and position them in their coresponding UL.  
### SHOUTOUTS!  
* Max Allee for helping me with the structure of the code.  
* nes.css Framework for being a super cool.  
* The Cat App for providing me with a good template to work from.
